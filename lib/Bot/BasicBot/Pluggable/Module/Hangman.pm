=head1 NAME

Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Hangman - IRC Hangman game

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

my $dictionary_file = '/usr/share/dict/words';
my $namespace = 'Reaper';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

A silly pointless IRC bot that provides a text version of Hangman for anyone
that's bored enough to play it :-)

    use Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Hangman;
    my $hangman = Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Hangman->new();

    # IRC
    !hangman       # Start a new game, uses a word from standard dictionary.
    !hangman-solo  # Like above, but exclusively for you.

    # Start a new PvP game using a specific word, if the optional nick is 
    # supplied then you challenge that person to a 1v1 game.
    /msg <bot-name> hangman <word> [<nick_of_player>] 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Bored? Play Hangman!  Challenge the bot to guess it's word or play against 
others using you're own words.

=head2 Modes of Play

=over 4

=item General Play

The general game, invoked by saying !hangman in a channel where the bot resides,
is commenced with an underscored representation of the word to be guessed. The
word is selected from the dictionary file by default but a custom file can be
specified. 

Players make their guesses by addressing the bot with a single letter.  The bot
will then reveal if that letter was correct or not.  If it was correct, all 
occurrences of that letter will appear in place in the word.  On an incorrect 
guess however, a life is removed.  A guess of the complete word can be made at 
any time by addressing the bot with the complete word.  

The object of the game is simple, the players must get the word correct before 
they run out of lives.  The players can win by guessing the correct letters to 
complete the word or by directly guessing the word.  

All players can participate in this mode of play.

=item Solo Play

The solo game follows the same format as the general game, with the exception
that the bot will only accept guesses from the player that started the game.
The solo game is invoked by saying !hangman-solo.

=item Challenge Mode

Challenge mode presents the opportunity for players to go head to head.  A 
player can specify their own word(s) to challenge others.  This can be in both
the general play format or against a specific player.

To begin a challenge game, a player sends a private message to the bot
containing the chosen word(s), and optionally the nick of a player to challenge.

=head1 WISHLIST

Eventually I want to add the following:

=over 4

=item Rules access method

A !command to effect the game parameters, such as word length, number of lives
etc.
